# Wabi Block Theme

[![Deploy](https://github.com/richtabor/wabi/actions/workflows/deploy.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/richtabor/wabi/actions/workflows/deploy.yml)

Share your authentic self with Wabi, a WordPress block theme designed to help you tell your story best. Wabi foregrounds the simplistic design language of storytelling through clean lines, beautiful typography and a dynamic accent color system. And with multiple style variants (light, dark, and dynamic color schemes), Wabi is the most expressive and adaptable writing theme yet.

## Getting Started

To get started with development:

1. Set up a WordPress instance, we recommend [wp-env](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/handbook/tutorials/devenv/) or [Local](https://localwp.com/) as an alternative to docker.
2. Clone / download this repository into your `/wp-content/themes/` directory

## Requirements

- WordPress 5.9+
- PHP 5.6+
- License: [GPLv2](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-2.0.html) or later

Some theme features / PRs may require Gutenberg trunk and will be described or tagged accordingly.

To optionally run tests locally, you will also need:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/)

You can install the test-specific development dependencies by running `npm i && composer install`. The following test commands are then available:

- `npm run lint:css` lints and autofixes where possible the CSS
- `composer run analyze [filename.php]` statically analyzes PHP for bugs
- `composer run lint` checks PHP for syntax errors
- `composer run standards:check` checks PHP for standards errors according to [WordPress coding standards](https://developer.wordpress.org/coding-standards/)
- `composer run standards:fix` attempts to automatically fix errors
